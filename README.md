# Image-Encryption-and-Decryption
 In this Java project, Iâ€™ve implemented robust image encryption and decryption functionality to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. Here are the key features:

Encryption Algorithm: Leveraging strong encryption techniques (such as AES or RSA), the project securely transforms image data into ciphertext. Key management ensures only authorized parties can decrypt the images.
Decryption Process: The decryption process reverses the encryption, allowing authorized users to retrieve the original image. Input/output streams efficiently handle large image files during this process.
Data Integrity: By incorporating checksums or digital signatures, we guarantee that the decrypted image matches the original, preventing tampering or corruption.
